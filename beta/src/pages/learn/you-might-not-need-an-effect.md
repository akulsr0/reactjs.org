title: 'You Might Not Need an Effect'
---

<Intro>

Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you "step outside" of React and synchronize your components with some external system like a non-React widget, network, or the browser DOM. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component's state when some props or state change), you shouldn't need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.

## How to remove unnecessary Effects {/*how-to-remove-unnecessary-effects*/}

There are two common cases in which you don't need Effects:

* **You don't need Effects to transform data for rendering.** For example, let's say you want to filter a list before displaying it. You might feel tempted to write an Effect that updates a state variable when the list changes. However, this is inefficient. When you update your component's state, React will first call your component functions to calculate what should be on the screen. Then React will ["commit"](/learn/render-and-commit) these changes to the DOM, updating the screen. Then React will run your Effects. If your Effect *also* immediately updates the state, this restarts the whole process from scratch! To avoid the unnecessary render passes, transform all the data at the top level of your components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change.
* **You don't need Effects to handle user events.** For example, let's say you want to send an `/api/buy` POST request and show a notification when the user buys a product. In the Buy button click event handlder, you know exactly what happened. By the time an Effect runs, you don't know *what* the user did (for example, which button was clicked). This is why you'll usually handle user events in the corresponding event handlers.

You *do* need Effects to [synchronize](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#what-are-effects-and-how-are-they-different-from-events) with external systems. For example, you can write an Effect that keeps a jQuery widget synchronized with the React state. You can also fetch data with Effects: for example, you can synchronize the search results with the current search query. Keep in mind that modern [frameworks](/learn/start-a-new-react-project#building-with-a-full-featured-framework) provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than writing Effects directly in your components.

To help you gain the right intuition, let's look at some common concrete examples!

### Updating state based on other state {/*updating-state-based-on-other-state*/}

Suppose you have a component with two state variables: `firstName` and `lastName`. You want to calculate a `fullName` from them by concatenating them. Moreover, you'd like `fullName` to update whenever `firstName` or `lastName` change. Your first instinct might be to add a `fullName` state variable and update it in an effect:

```js {5-9}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');

  // 🔴 Bad: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);
  // ...
}
```

This is more complicated than necessary. It is inefficient too: it does an entire render pass with a stale value for `fullName`, then immediately re-renders with the updated value. Remove both the state variable and the Effect:

```js {4-5}
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
  // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  // ...
}
```

**When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, [don't put it in state.](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure#avoid-redundant-state) Instead, calculate it during rendering.** This makes your code faster (you avoid the extra "cascading" updates), simpler (you remove some code), and less error-prone (you avoid bugs caused by different state variables getting out of sync with each other). If this approach feels new to you, [Thinking in React](/learn/thinking-in-react#step-3-find-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state) has some guidance on what should go into state.

### Caching expensive calculations {/*caching-expensive-calculations*/}

This component computes `visibleTodos` by taking the `todos` it receives by props and filtering them according to the `filter` prop. You might feel tempted to store the result in a state variable and update it in an Effect:

```js {4-8}
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');

  // 🔴 Bad: redundant state and unnecessary Effect
  const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    setVisibleTodos(getFilteredTodos(todos, filter));
  }, [todos, filter]);

  // ...
}
```

Like in the earlier example, this is both unnecessary and inefficient. First, remove the state and the Effect:

```js {3-4}
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  // ✅ This is fine if getFilteredTodos() is not slow.
  const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
  // ...
}
```

In many cases, this code is fine! But maybe `getFilteredTodos()` is slow or you have a lot of `todos`. In that case you don't want to recalculate `getFilteredTodos()` if some unrelated state variable like `newTodo` has changed.

You can cache (or ["memoize"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)) an expensive calculation by wrapping it [`useMemo`](/apis/usememo) Hook:

```js {5-8}
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
    // ✅ Does not re-run unless todos or filter change
    return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
  }, [todos, filter]);
  // ...
}
```

Or, written as a single line:

```js {5-6}
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState('');
  // ✅ Does not re-run getFilteredTodos() unless todos or filter change
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => getFilteredTodos(todos, filter), [todos, filter]);
  // ...
}
```

**This tells React that you don't want the inner function to re-run unless either `todos` or `filter` have changed.** React will remember the return value of `getFilteredTodos()` during the initial render. During the next renders, it will check if `todos` or `filter` are different. If they're the same as last time, `useMemo` will return the last result it has stored. But if they are different, React will call the wrapped function again (and store _that_ result instead).

The function you wrap in [`useMemo`](/apis/usememo) runs during rendering, so this only works for [pure calculations](/learn/keeping-components-pure).

<DeepDive title="How to tell if a calculation is expensive?">

In general, unless you're creating or looping over thousands of objects, it's probably not expensive. If you want to get more confidence, you can add a console log to measure the time spent in a piece of code:

```js {1,3}
console.time('filter array');
const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);
console.timeEnd('filter array');
```

Perform the interaction you're measuring (for example, typing into the input). You will then see logs like `filter array: 0.15ms` in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, `1ms` or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in `useMemo` to verify whether the total logged time has decreased for that interaction or not:

```js
console.time('filter array');
const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
  return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter); // Skipped if todos and filter haven't changed
}, [todos, filter]);
console.timeEnd('filter array');
```

`useMemo` won't make the *first* render faster. It only helps you skip unnecessary work on updates.

Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users' so it's a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a [CPU Throttling](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-61/#throttling) option for this.

Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when [Strict Mode](/apis/strictmode) is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have.

### Resetting all state when a prop changes {/*resetting-all-state-when-a-prop-changes*/}

This `ProfilePage` component receives a `userId` prop. The page contains a comment input, and you use a `comment` state variable to hold its value. One day, you notice a problem: when you navigate from one profile to another, the `comment` state does not get reset. As a result, it's easy to accidentally post a comment on a wrong user's profile. To fix the issue, you want to clear out the `comment` state variable whenever the `userId` changes:

```js {4-7}
function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');

  // 🔴 Bad: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setComment('');
  }, [userId]);
  // ...
}
```

This is inefficient because `ProfilePage` and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again. It is also complicated because you'd need to do this in *every* component that has some state inside `ProfilePage`. For example, if the comment UI is nested, you'd want to clear out nested comment state too.

Instead, you can tell React that each user's profile is conceptually a _different_ profile by giving it an explicit key:

```js {5,11-12}
function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  return (
    <Profile
      userId={userId} 
      key={userId}
    />
  );
}

function Profile({ userId }) {
  // ✅ This and any other state below will reset on key change automatically
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');
  // ...
}
```

**Normally, React preserves the state when the same component is rendered in the same spot. By passing `userId` as a `key` to the `Profile` component, you're asking React to treat two `Profile` components with different `userId` as two different components that should not share any state.** Whenever the key (which you've set to `userId`) changes, React will recreate the DOM and [reset the state](/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#option-2-resetting-state-with-a-key) of the `Profile` component and all of its children. As a result, the `comment` field will clear out automatically when navigating between profiles.

### Adjusting some state when a prop changes {/*adjusting-some-state-when-a-prop-changes*/}

Sometimes, you might want to reset or adjust a part of the state on a prop change, but not all of it.

This `List` component receives a list of `items` as a prop, and maintains the selected item in the `selection` state variable. You want to reset the `selection` to `null` whenever the `items` prop receives a different array:

```js {5-8}
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // 🔴 Bad: Adjusting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setSelection(null);
  }, [items]);
  // ...
}
```

This, too, is not ideal. Every time the `items` change, the `List` and its child components will render with a stale `selection` value at first. Then React will update the DOM and run the Effects. Finally, the `setSelection(null)` call will cause another re-render of the `List` and its child components, restarting this whole process again.

Start by deleting the Effect. Instead, adjust the state directly during rendering:

```js {5-11}
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // Better: Adjust the state while rendering
  const [prevItems, setPrevItems] = useState(items);
  if (items !== prevItems) {
    setPrevItems(items);
    setSelection(null);
  }
  // ...
}
```

**This pattern can be hard to understand, but it’s better than updating state in an Effect.** In the above example, `setSelection` is called directly during a render. React will re-render the `List` *immediately* after it exits with a `return` statement. By that point, React hasn't rendered the `List` children or updated the DOM yet, so this lets the `List` children skip rendering the stale `selection` value. [Read more about using this pattern correctly.](/apis/usestate#storing-information-from-previous-renders)

Before moving on, consider whether you can further simplify the requirements to calculate everything during rendering. For example, instead of storing (and resetting) the selected *item*, you can store the selected *item ID:*

```js {3-5}
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);
  // ✅ Best: Calculate everything during rendering
  const selection = items.find(item => item.id === selectedId) ?? null;
  // ...
}
```

Now there is no need to "adjust" the state at all. If the item with the selected ID is in the list, it remains selected. If it's not, the `selection` calculated during rendering will be `null` because no matching item was found. This behavior is a bit different, but arguably it's better because most changes to `items` now preserve the selection. However, you'd need to use `selection` in all the logic below because an item with `selectedId` might not exist.

### Sharing logic between event handlers {/*sharing-logic-between-event-handlers*/}

Let's say you have a product page with two buttons (Buy and Checkout) that both let you buy that product. You want to show a notification [toast](https://uxdesign.cc/toasts-or-snack-bars-design-organic-system-notifications-1236f2883023) whenever the user puts the product in the cart. Adding the `showToast()` call to both button's click handlers feels repetitive so you might be tempted to place this logic in an Effect:

```js {2-7}
function ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) {
  // 🔴 Bad: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    if (product.isInCart) {
      showToast(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`);
    }
  }, [product]);

  function handleBuyClick() {
    addToCart(product);
  }

  function handleCheckoutClick() {
    addToCart(product);
    navigateTo('/checkout');
  }
  // ...
}
```

This Effect is unnecessary. It will also most likely cause bugs. For example, let's say that your app "remembers" the shopping cart between the page reloads. If you add a product to the cart once and refresh the page, the notification toast will appear again. It will keep appearing every time you refresh that product's page. This is because `product.isInCart` will already be `true` on the page load, so the Effect above will call `showToast()`.

**When you're not sure whether some code should be in an Effect or in an event handler, ask yourself *why* this code needs to run. Use Effects only for code that should run *because* the component was displayed to the user.** In this example, the toast should appear because the user *pressed the button*, not because the product page was displayed! Delete the Effect and put the shared logic into a function that you call from both event handlers:

```js {2-6,9,13}
function ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) {
  // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is called from event handlers
  function buyProduct() {
    addToCart(product);
    showToast(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`);    
  }

  function handleBuyClick() {
    buyProduct();
  }

  function handleCheckoutClick() {
    buyProduct();
    navigateTo('/checkout');
  }
  // ...
}
```

This both removes the unnecessary Effect and fixes the bug.

### Notifying parent components about state changes {/*notifying-parent-components-about-state-changes*/}

Let's say you're writing a `Toggle` component with an internal `isOn` state which can be either `true` or `false`. There are a few different ways to toggle it (by clicking or dragging). You want to notify the parent component whenever the `Toggle` internal state changes, so you expose an `onChange` event and call it from an Effect:

```js {4-7}
function Toggle({ onChange }) {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  // 🔴 Bad: The onChange handler runs too late
  useEffect(() => {
    onChange(isOn);
  }, [isOn, onChange])

  function handleClick() {
    setIsOn(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      setIsOn(true);
    } else {
      setIsOn(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

Like earlier, this is not ideal. The `Toggle` updates its state first, and React updates the screen. Then React runs the Effect, which calls the `onChange` function passed from a parent component. Now the parent component will update its own state, starting another render pass. It would be better to do everything in a single pass instead.

Delete the Effect and instead update the state of *both* components within the same event handler:

```js {5-7,11,16,18}
function Toggle({ onChange }) {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  function updateToggle(nextIsOn) {
    // ✅ Good: Perform all updates during the event that caused them
    setIsOn(nextIsOn);
    onChange(nextIsOn);
  }

  function handleClick() {
    updateToggle(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      updateToggle(true);
    } else {
      updateToggle(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

With this approach, both the `Toggle` component and its parent component update their state during the event. React [batches updates](/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) from different components together, so there will only be one render pass as a result.

You might also be able to remove the state altogether, and instead receive `isOn` from the parent component:

```js {1,2}
// ✅ Good: the component is fully controlled by its parent
function Toggle({ isOn, onChange }) {
  function handleClick() {
    onChange(!isOn);
  }

  function handleDragEnd(e) {
    if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) {
      onChange(true);
    } else {
      onChange(false);
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

["Lifting state up"](/learn/sharing-state-between-components) lets the parent component fully control the `Toggle` by toggling the parent's own state. This means the parent component will have to contain more logic, but there will be less state overall to worry about. Whenever you try to keep two different state variables synchronized, it's a sign to try lifting state up instead!

<Recap>

- If you can calculate something during render, you don't need an Effect.
- To cache expensive calculations, add `useMemo` instead of `useEffect`.
- To reset the state of an entire component tree, pass a different `key` to it.
- To reset a particular bit of state in response to a prop change, set it during rendering.
- Code that needs to run because a component was *displayed* should be in Effects, the rest should be in events.
- If you need to update the state of several components, it's better to do it during a single event.
- Whenever you try to synchronize state variables in different components, consider lifting state up.
